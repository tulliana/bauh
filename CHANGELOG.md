### Improvements
- Arch
    - faster caching data process during initialization
    - i18n
- AppImage
    - Categories are now translated on the Info window
    
- UI
    - only centralizing the apps table after the initialization process
    - defining a minimum width and height based on the screen size
    - info window now has a height limit, a lower bar with Back and Close buttons, and is scrollable
    - minor changes
- Downloads
    - retrieving the downloading file sizes asynchronously

### Fixes
- Flatpak
    - not displaying application updates on the search results
- Arch
    - crashing while reading the installed packages when the internet is unstable

- initialization dialog hangs when there is no task to wait for [#112](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/112)
- not caching data of installed packages with no signatures and unknown repositories


## [0.9.3] 2020-05-12
### Features
- new **restore** action to restore all bauh settings and cache through the 'custom actions' button (**+**). It is equivalent to the command `bauh --reset`.

### Improvements
- some custom actions not related to installed packages state will not refresh the table after succeeded

### Fixes
- Arch
    - "clean cache" operation was not working in some scenarios
    - upgrading progress when conflicting files are detected
    - not detecting some installed "not-signed" repository packages
    - not properly caching data of installed dependencies
- UI
    - some fields in the table are overlapped by others when maximized [#107](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/107)
    
- upgrade: crashing when there are packages to be displayed on the summary window that cannot upgrade
- settings: crashing when an empty Qt style is detected or defined [#104](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/104)


### Recommendations
- Arch-based distro users: clean the bauh's Arch cache after upgrading to this release so it will remap all installed packages during the next initialization. 3 possible ways to do it:

    - type on the command line: `rm -rf ~/.cache/bauh/arch/installed` (it will reset only the Arch cache)
    - type on the command line: `bauh --reset` (it will reset all caches and settings)
    - click on the new **Restore** custom action on the UI (it will reset all caches and settings)


## [0.9.2] 2020-05-04
### Features
- UI
    - it is possible to view details of some initialization tasks by clicking on their icons

- UI
    - not displaying some priority search results at the top of the table


## [0.8.3] - 2020-02-13
### Improvements
- New update lifecycle:
    - now every package manager must provide all requirements before upgrading all selected packages ( can be disabled through the settings file **~/.config/bauh/config.yml** or the UI )
    - now every package manager must provide the best upgrade order for all the selected packages ( can be disabled through the settings file **~/.config/bauh/config.yml** or the UI )
- AUR
    - allowing the user to bypass checksum errors when installing / upgrading / downgrading packages
    - improved how missing dependencies are checked when installing a new package ( the old way was not identifying some missing dependencies of **anbox-git** ). It is possible to use the old algorithm by setting **simple_checking** to **true** in **~/.config/bauh/arch.yml**. More information at [README](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/#aur--arch-).
    - checking architecture dependencies (x86_64, i686)

- handling internet timeout errors
- minor fixes
    

## [0.8.2] - 2020-01-31
### Features
- New **Settings** panel ( displayed when the lower **Settings** button is clicked ). It allows to change all settings.

### Improvements
- Flatpak
    - configuration file ( **flatpak.yml** ) will be created during the initialization ( on **0.8.1** it would only be created during the first app installation )
- AUR
    - the custom **makepkg.conf** generated at **~/.config/bauh/arch** will enable **ccache** if available on the system
    - downgrading time reduced due to the fix described in ***Fixes***
    - package databases synchronization once a day ( or every device reboot ) before the first package installation / upgrade / downgrade. This behavior can be disabled on **~/.config/arch.yml** / or the new settings panel
    ```
    sync_databases: true  # enabled by default
    ```
- Configuration ( **~/.config/bauh/config.yml** )
    - new property **hdpi** allowing to disable HDPI improvements
    ```
    ui:
        hdpi: true # enabled by default

    for some desktop environments ( like Gnome ) [#1](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/1)
    ```
     ui:
        auto_scale: false  # disabled by default
    ```
### Fixes
- AUR
    - not treating **makedepends** as a list during dependency checking ( **anbox-git** installation was crashing )
    - not considering the package name itself as **provided** during dependency checking ( **anbox-git** installation was crashing )
    - not pre-downloading some source files ( e.g: from **anbox-image** )
    - not able to install packages based on other packages ( package name != package base ). e.g: **anbox-modules-dkms-git** > **anbox-git**
    - downgrade: pre-downloading sources from the latest version instead of the older
- Flatpak
    - downgrade: displaying "No Internet connection" when an error happens during commits reading
    - Flatpak < 1.5: an exception happens when trying to retrieve the information from partials
- UI:
    - **About** window icons scaling
    - Toolbar buttons get hidden [#5](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/5)
    - not displaying icons retrieved from a HTTP redirect
    - minor bug fixes
    
### UI
- **Style selector** and **Application types** menu action moved to the new **Settings panel**
- **About** menu action split from the **Settings** menu as a new button

- Flatpak
    - the application name tooltip now displays the installation level. e.g: **gedit ( system )**
    - info window displaying the installation level
    - "remote not set" warning dropped in favor of the new behavior: automatically adds Flathub as the default remote at the user level
- Snap
    - snapd checking routine refactored
- Web
    - not using HTTP sessions anymore to perform the searches. It seems to avoid URLs not being found after an internet drop event
    - supporting JPEG images as custom icons
- UI
    - widgets visibility settings: the main widgets now should always be visible ( e.g: toolbar buttons )
    - scaling
    
### Fixes
- missing categories i18n [#48](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/48)
- Flatpak:
    - updating application dependencies during updating and downgrading
- Web:
    - not handling HTTP connection issues
- not passing the Home path as a String for subprocesses ( an exception happens for Python 3.5 )

## [0.8.0] 2019-12-24
### Features
- Native Web applications support:
    - if an URL is typed on the search bar, a native web application result will be displayed on the table.
    - bauh relies on [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and [nativefier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier) to install the Web applications, but there is no need to have them installed on your system. Bauh will create its own installation environment with these technologies in **~/.local/share/bauh/web/env**.
    - suggestions are retrieved from [suggestions.txt](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/blob/master/web/suggestions.yml)
    - requires only **python-beautifulsoup4** and **python-lxml** to be enabled
- **Suggestions** button: it shows some application suggestions 

### Improvements
- configuration file **~/.config/bauh/config.json** renamed to **~/.config/bauh/config.yml**
- some parameters and environment variables were moved to the configuration file ( **~/.config/bauh/config.yml** )
```
disk_cache:  # old '--disk_cache'
  enabled: true
download:
  icons: true # old '--download-icons'
  multithreaded: true  # old '--download-mthread'
gems: null 
locale: null  # old '--locale'
memory_cache:
  data_expiration: 3600 # old '--cache-exp'
  icon_expiration: 300  # old '--icon-exp'
suggestions:
  by_type: 10  # new -> defines the max number of suggestions by package type
  enabled: true  # old '--sugs'
system:
  notifications: true  # old '--system-notifications'
  single_dependency_checking: false  # old '---check-packaging-once'
ui:
  style: null  
  table:
    max_displayed: 50  # old '--max-displayed'
  tray:
    default_icon: null  # old environment variable 'BAUH_TRAY_DEFAULT_ICON_PATH'
    updates_icon: null  # old environment variable 'BAUH_TRAY_UPDATES_ICON_PATH'
updates:
  check_interval: 30  # old '--check-interval'

```
- The default update checking interval is now 30 seconds
- New tray icons loading priority: 
    1) Icon paths defined in **~/.config/bauh/config.yml**
    2) Icons from the system with the following names: `bauh_tray_default` and `bauh_tray_updates`
    3) Own packaged icons
- Now bauh considers the default system icon for the notifications and panel. If there is none, then it will use its own.
- AppImage:
    - cleaning the downloaded database files when **--reset** is passed as parameter
    - environment variables **BAUH_APPIMAGE_DB_UPDATER** and **BAUH_APPIMAGE_DB_UPDATER_TIME** dropped in favor of the new configuration file located at **~/.config/bauh/appimage.yml**
    - suggestions are now retrieved from [suggestions.txt](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh-files/blob/master/appimage/suggestions.txt)
- AUR:
    - The AUR indexer daemon is not running every 20 minutes anymore. It will only run during the boot, and will generate the optimized index
    at **/tmp/bauh/arch/aur.txt**. This new behavior does not harm the current experience, and reduces memory usage. More information about this behavior in [README](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/blob/master/README.md).
    - Environment variable **BAUH_ARCH_AUR_INDEX_UPDATER** dropped in favor of the behavior described above.

- Minor memory improvements
- Minor UI improvements

### Fixes
- AUR:
    - an exception happens when retrieving matches from the cached AUR index
    - not using the optimized compilation settings if the custom makepkg file is not found during the installation process
- minor fixes

## [0.7.5] 2019-12-20
### Fixes
- Fix missing i18n keys when there are no mapped translations for the system's default locale [#40](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/40)
- Tray icon is not updating its status after an application is uninstalled

## [0.7.4] 2019-12-09

- AppImage
    - AppImage updater daemon replaced by a default Python thread to reduce memory usage
- AUR
    - The optimized **makepkg.conf** file is now generated at **~/.config/bauh/arch/makepkg.conf** and passed as a parameter during package builds to not provoke the auto-merge of **/etc/makepkg.conf** and the old generated **~/.makepkg.conf**.
    (P.S: if your **~/.makepkg.conf** was generated by bauh, consider deleting it as it will be useless for bauh now and may impact your other Arch compilation tools). Behavior discussed in [#30](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/30).
    - Removing an unnecessary **prepare** step executed during dependency checking reducing the packages installation time. Also this step was preventing some packages to install due to its repeated execution ( e.g: xdman )

    - New package suggestions
- Caching Snap and Flatpak suggestions [#23](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/23)
